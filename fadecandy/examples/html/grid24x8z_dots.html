    /*
     * This is a self-contained for controlling Fadecandy from JavaScript.
     * We use the popular Paper.js library for drawing and vector math,
     * and we communicate with the LEDs via a WebSocket connection to fcserver.
     *
     * The fcserver must be running before loading the page.
     * Assumes an 8x8 LED matrix in top-down left-right order is connected
     * to the first channel of an attached Fadecandy board.
     *
     * This example is released into the public domain.
     * Feel free to use it as a starting point for your own projects.
     *
     * BROWSER SUPPORT:
     *   - Firefox: Works really well
     *   - Safari: Unusable. Runs for a few seconds, then stops.
     *   - Chrome: Pretty good, but not as fast as Firefox.
